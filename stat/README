This directory (``stat``) contains R (http://r-project.org) scripts useful for
summarizing statistical qualities of OpenMRS patient database dumps, such as
entropy and mutual information.

They process pipe-delimited files, which you can do as follows:

    > source('singmet.R')
    > source('pairmet.R')
    > records <- read.table('filename', header=F, sep='|')
    > singmet(records)
    > pairmet(records)

Dependencies:
    - entropy package (available on CRAN)
